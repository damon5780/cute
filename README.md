        <p id="message">❤️ You don't know that you are very special to me. When I first saw you, it felt like magic to me, as I had never seen a girl like you before. After knowing you for the last few months, I also came to realize that you are a sweet and nurturing person, and that's what I like about you so much. ❤️<br><br>
        ❤️ I know that some days of your life are very tough, but don't let them break you. Face those days and speak up for yourself. Don't let anyone control you, as I know that's the one thing you hate. I haven't spent much time alone with you, but I want to say that you are and will be the first and last girl I like in college, and my feelings for you will remain the same. ❤️<br><br>
        ❤️ There are many things that hurt me, but in the end, it is what it is. Thank you for being around me... ❤️</p>
